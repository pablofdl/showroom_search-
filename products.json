Not suitable for children under 3 years. Brand Story The company that was destined to become LEGO started life as being a small workshop that produced wooden toys, run by Ole Kirk Christiansen in 1932. The name ‘LEGO’ was adopted in 1934, coming from the Danish phrase ‘leg godt’, which means ‘play well’. It wasn’t until 1947 that they started producing plastic toys, with the first version of the now infamous interlocking bricks coming in 1949. They weren’t quite the bricks that people are used to nowadays, being made from a different material and having a slightly different locking system. It was actually Christiansen’s son Godtfred Kirk that saw the potential for the bricks to become a tool for creative play and in 1958, the modern brick design was born. From this date, despite variation in the design and purpose of individual pieces over the years, each remains compatible in some way with previous pieces. So you could have a LEGO set from 1958 and it would still be completely compatible with a modern set. Since the 1960, thousands of sets have been released covering everything from Aliens to the Wild West. The only area that the company has never tackled directly is military-themed sets, because Ole Kirk set a policy that they must never make war seem like child’s play. The largest ever LEGO set to date is a scale-model of the Taj Mahal, which was made out of 5922 pieces. The LEGO Group's motto is ‘det bedste er ikke for godt’, which roughly translates to \"only the best is the best\". Ole Kirk Christiansen came up with this phrase to encourage workers to always produce the highest quality toys possible. Nowadays, LEGO makes a vast range of toys for all ages, as well as teaching materials for children, which are distributed in over 130 countries. The company has approximately 10,000 employees and is the world's third largest manufacturer of play materials.","price":69.99,"supplier":"John Lewis","brand":"LEGO"}

Brand Wilson Eligible for International Delivery YES Washing Instructions Machine washable at 30°C Women's Sportswear Type Socks Editor's Notes Now a global super brand, Nike started from humble beginnings in 1950s America. A college track coach named Bill Bowerman, and an athlete named Phil Knight, combined their skills and knowledge to bring innovation to the world of running shoes. One of these innovations was inspired by Bill Bowerman’s waffle iron. Bowerman realised that by creating gridded grip on the soles of their shoes, the shoe would have greater traction yet still propel the runner forward. From the start, Nike recognised the significant correlation between equipment and performance. They carry this guiding principle through all of their products, whether it's the football kit for the Brazilian national team, golfing gear for Tiger Woods or your running shoes. The brand continues to seek new and innovative ways to develop superior athletic products; this can be seen in the technology worked into improving your running experience with Nike+ products.","price":7.0,"supplier":"John Lewis","brand":"Wilson"}

Below are a few options to consider when choosing your perfect china. Earthenware Strong and practical, perfect for everyday. Its cream colour and low firing temperatures allow for designed pieces. Stoneware Tougher than earthenware and chip resistant. Ideal for heavy use and can often go into the oven to temperatures of up to 250°C. Terracotta Uses a clay with a rich body colour giving the characteristic base colour, and has a low glaze firing allowing bright coloured glazes. Porous body allows for good thermal expansion and contraction properties making it an ideal body for cookware such as tagines and roasters. Porcelain Delicate yet strong. Carefully selected clays give whiteness and translucency. It can often go from oven to table. Fine china The synthetic bone ash used in fine china makes it a more affordable alternative to bone china whilst maintaining the benefits - strength, translucency \u0026 delicacy. Bone china Bone china is made from 40% bone ash. This makes strong yet thin and delicate pieces which are microwave, dishwasher* and oven safe making each piece ideal for everyday use, not just formal. * Unless product has metallic details - always check individual item for specific care instructions","price":41.0,"supplier":"John Lewis","brand":"PiP Studio"}

Martin Blum’s wife is Japanese. He would come to work with a traditional bento box, that was beautifully designed and presented the Japanese food inside in a much more desirable way than standard food containers. Looking at lunch boxes in the western market, we realised that children had the option of fun lunch boxes, but for adults, there was very little on the market. This inspired us to redesign the lunchbox and was the starting point for the whole box appetit range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr class=\"clear\"\u003e \u003cbr class=\"clear\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"fourteen columns offset-by-one\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Black Blum Lunch Box Box Appetit \" src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0957/0496/files/box-instructions_1024x1024.jpg?16166483641347288069\" style=\"float: none;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","price":16.95,"supplier":"Black + Blum","brand":"black+blum"}

{"title":"Sisley Cellulinov Intensive Anti-Cellulite Body Care, 200ml","description":"An innovative and complete body care: anti-dimple, moisturizing, firming, skin perfecting. Cellulinov is an intensive anti-cellulite* body care, which targets the look of cellulite thanks to an exceptional synergy of plant-based active ingredients and essential oils, resulting from the latest advances from Sisley Research. Longan Seed, Red Algae and Indian Lotus extracts are combined with Caffeine and Cedrol to provide targeted action on the appearance of cellulite. Its creamy, velvety texture is ideal for prolonged massage. Dimples are reduced, orange peel skin is smoothed and the silhouette is reshaped. Skin is visibly more beautiful: firmer, incredibly soft, as if like new. * Refers to the appearance of cellulite Usage tips: Apply morning and evening to areas of concern and massage until the product has been fully absorbed. Use as a special treatment several times a year. Massage advice: 1. On the thighs and buttocks: use both hands to encircle the thighs and apply strong pressure from the bottom of the thigh to the top to stimulate drainage. Then use closed fists to vigorously massage the target areas on the thighs and buttocks, using circular strokes. 2. On the stomach: unblock built-up tissue with gentle pinches across the surface of the stomach. Then contract the abdominal muscles and, using the palm of the hand, smooth the skin outwards from the navel. Finish with circular movements upon the hips. Results: From the first application, the skin's beauty is enhanced: it is durably moisturized and is softer and smoother. After 4 week's use, dimples are reduced, orange peel skin is smoothed, the appearance of cellulite is visibly reduced (visually and upon pinching), the thigh cicumference is thinner and the silhouette is reshaped.
